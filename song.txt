I'm tired of being what you want me to be
feeling so faithless 
lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
put under the pressure
of walking in your shoes
-caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow-
every step that I take is another mistake to you
-caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow-

I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
become so tired
so much more aware
I'm becoming this
all I want to do
is be more like me
and be less like you


Can't you see that you're smothering me
holding too tightly 
afraid to lose control 
because everything that you thought I would be 
has fallen apart right in front of you


-Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow-
every step that I take is another mistake to you
-caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow-
and every second I waste
is more than I can take

I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
become so tired
so much more aware
I'm becoming this
all I want to do
is be more like me
and be less like you


But I know I may end up failing too 
but I know you were just like me 
with someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
become so tired
so much more aware
I'm becoming this
all I want to do
is be more like me
and be less like you


Become so numb
-telling me what you want me to be-
I've become so numb
-telling me what you want me to be
